Woven hedges have been around for a long time and were widely used as field fencing in the past. The hedges consist of small trees and shrubs, often with spines or thorns, woven together to provide a strong fence. We plant the different varieties in random order and after growing out for 5-6 years, the trees are braided and pruned, creating a natural hedge of between 1.5 and 2 meters high. At this farm, cows walking along on both sides of the hedge will do most of the pruning, making the hedge increasingly full and more attractive to insects and birds. A wicker hedge is an important addition to countryside biodiversity!</p>","subscription_instructions":"<p></p>"}},{"id":9017,"name":"PMO bridge planting","slug":"PMO-bridge-planting","tags":[61787,61807,440],"fields":{"lat":54.70289276719894,"date":"26-10-2024","long":25.36924092629654,"open":"Closed Event","host-name":"Myliu mišką","event-name":"PMO bridge planting","country-code":"LT","event_details":"<p>PMO bridge organizes events for project managers and instead of giving a goodie bag, they support NGO Myliu miska and in their name they plant a tree!
